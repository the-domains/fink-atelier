            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wearable Sun Protection</h1><p>There's no faster way to throw shade on a warm weather vacation (or the first few hot days of spring) than with sunburn. It takes only 15 minutes of direct sunlight exposure for skin damage to begin occurring, so protection is a must.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/02b678fdc35ac511ae64c114def378f383b690e1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Fresh Take On Coffee T-Shirts</h1><p>The coffee shop has always been one of the great incubators for artist-types. It's a home base for creative nomads, where those not shackled to desk jobs go to sketch, write, or just ideate into leather-bound notepads, propped up only by a cup of coffee and, depending on your location and era, a pack of cigarettes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99ea5a102a376f1a2a0d9187d3764592ee86f921.jpg"></article>]]></description>
